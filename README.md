# Wiki-Game
This Application is a bot that crawls Wikipedia sites.

It tries to find the shortest way from a given start page, to a given target page,
by downloading the html-Files and rekursively searching any possibility.

It is following more or less the rules of the [Wiki-Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game),
but it allows Dates (specifid Days and months) and locations, while Years can be filtered as you desire.
Of course the rule to not use a bot is broken.

The nature of this method ***requires a high amount of data*** (the highest possible bancwitch to the next Wikipedia-Server), so watch your consumption if it's limited.
 
 
 As it started as a two method console project, the code is a bit messy...
